😃🌞👫☕️🍵🎾🎧

**I am currently a Ph.D. student major in Control Science and Engineering at Hunan University (HNU), working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Min Liu](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1291/5218.htm) (DIRECT) and Prof. Dr. [Yaonan Wang](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1277/4490.htm) (INDIRECT). My research interests include industrial vision and medical image anylasis. Before entering Hunan University, I received my M.Eng. (supervised by Prof. Dr. [Kai Hu](https://jwxy.xtu.edu.cn/info/1147/2508.htm) and Prof. Dr. [Xieping Gao](https://scholar.hunnu.edu.cn/gaoxieping/index.htm)) and B.S. degree from Xiangtan University (XTU) in 2023 and 2020.
